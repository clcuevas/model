This model is to illustrate the problem when an individual doesn't know if he/she is going to meet the requirements for a Driver's License. The process begins with the individual submitting their information. The information being submitted by the individual is:

1. Name
2. Age 
3. Written exam score 
4. Driver's test score

Based on information given, the online simulator will tell the applicants whether they pass of fail the requirements. The requirements for a driver's license are:

1. Is this individual 18 years or older?
2. Has this individual passed their written exam?
3. Has this individual passed their driving exam?

If all these requirements have been met, then the tool will notify the individual that they qualify for a Driver's license. The individual must meet all three requirements to be approved. If they do not meet these requirements, they will be notified of this and will also have a button they can click that will display these requirements. We have also given the individual the option to 'Contact Us' for further information, etc.
