This model is to illustrate the process of an individual getting issued a Driver's License for the first time. This process begins with the individual submitting their information into the DMV's portal. The information being submitted by the individual is:

1. Full Name
2. Date of Birth
3. Address

This information gives a description to the DMV office about the invidual requesting a new license. Once this information is submitted, the individual will also be asked if they have passed or failed their written exam and their driving test.

When the DMV location receives a request from the individual for a new license, they will be reviewing the below information:

1. Who this individual is?
2. Is this individual 18 years or older?
3. Has this individual pass their written exam?
4. Has this individual pass their driving exam?

If all these requirements have been met, then the DMV office will approve this individual for a new license. They will acquire the individual's full name and address. This information will provide them with the information needed to order a new Driver's License to be created. 

When the Driver's License is ordered by the DMV and it has been created (or printed) it will be mailed to the individual's home address.

The Driver's License will contain the individual's characteristics (i.e. Full Name, DOB, eye color, etc.).
